How to do code analysis with sonarqube for python projects.

Code quality is often associated with a set of standard code metrics.

This little guide is about using the tools from sonar to keep track of code
metrics when working with python based projects. The sonar tools are the 
sonarqube server and the sonar code scanner. This guide is also about the 
specific python tools to actually calculate the code metrics.

## Sonarqube & sonar-scanner
Sonarqube is a web server capable of keeping track of various code metrics as:

+ technical debt (how much of your code is not documented)
+ code smells (known code patterns that are usually bad practice), 
+ code coverage (how much of your code is tested)
+ security (how many known security flaws are detected)

Sonarqube is a server that will keep track of the different metrics (in
a database) and has a web interface. The web interface keeps track of metrics
for different projects, each project having it's own place and configuration.
There are some dashboards present in the server as default, but they can be 
refined and new ones can be created.

### Usage scenarios
If you are collaborating in a software project where python is used, you can 
use sonarqube to analyse the code of the project, at different moments, and at
different places. You can calculate your code metrics _before_ creating a
commit, or you can wait for the commit to be pushed to the repository, and let
code reviews and continuous integration do it. We can consider that if you
do the analysis before a commit, it is *local*, and that an analysis done after
the commit is pushed, is *remote*. 

When using sonarqube as the server that keeps track of the metrics, you need
a tool to go over your code, and run the different tools that will calculate
the metrics. In the sonar ecosystem, this tool is the sonar-scanner. It is 
capable of calculating itself some of the metrics, depending on the language,
but for python, some of the most important metrics are actually calculated
with third party tools like *pytest*, *bandit* and *pylint*.

### Flow

If you read up to here, you know that:

> There is a *client* (sonar-scanner) - *server* (sonarqube)  architecture

> There are two usage scenarios: local (pre-commit analysis) and remote

Putting all in practice requires installing sonar-scanner in your development
machine, and a running sonarqube server.

For the *local* scenario, this guide will consider using a container to run
the sonarqube server. For the *remote* one, we will use a github app linked to
a repository.

## Requirements

### Sonar-scanner

Please install `sonar-scanner`. This should be a simple thing to do in this 
century, but I can't guarantee that (myself being born in the previous century).
The [sonar-scanner website](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner)
basically only provides an archive (zip, tar, you name it) and asks you to
update your PATH environment variable. 

> In linux, you don't really have to mess with your PATH variable if you don't 
> want to do it. You can safely expand the archive (to /usr/share, or your home
> directory) and invoke the sonar-scanner command directly. 

You can install `sonar-scanner` in linux by issuing:

```bash
# the exact URL comes from the sonar-scanner website
cd ~/Downloads
wget "https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonar-scanner-cli/sonar-scanner-cli-3.3.0.1492-linux.zip"
sudo unzip sonar-scanner-cli-3.3.0.1492-linux.zip -d /opt
```

After expanding the zip file, you must add the `/opt/sonar-scanner-3.3.0.1492-linux/bin/`
to your path. You can do this _permanently_ by editing your shell configuration
(`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) or temporarily. 

```zsh
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/sonar-scanner-3.3.0.1492-linux/bin/
```

Test that it works by invoking `sonar-scanner` in your terminal. You should 
see something like:

```bash
[tomas@pc pycodeq]$ sonar-scanner

```

## Sonarqube

### Local container

Get [docker ce installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) in your development
machine.

Once you have docker up and running (you managed to do the hello-world test),
get a copy of the sonarqube image with:

```bash
docker pull sonarqube
```

Launch a container of this image, making sure you expose port 9000 to the outside:

```bash
docker run -d --rm --name sonarqube -p 90000:9000 sonarqube
```

the `-d` flag is there to make the container run in the background (maybe
during your development phase). Please notice that the start time of the server
is not exactly quick. Allow some little time before pointing your web-browser
to [your local sonarqube](http://localhost:9000/).

> If you want to make sure you will not forget to shut down the container
> before leaving your development session, run the container without the `-d`
> flag, but this will block your terminal session.

> If you ran the container in using the `-d` flag, you can attach to the 
> container logs by issuing `docker logs -f sonarqube`. This can be useful
> to see when the server is completely operational. 

#### admin admin

Once the sonarqube server is up and running, you are _almost_ ready to execute 
`sonar-scanner` inside the directory of your project. The default image of
`sonarqube` does not have the pylint rules activated by default. We must
activate them before doing an analysis.
[See here for the issue](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/pylint-and-qualityprofile/5462/9) 

### Activate pylint rules

Since we are going to change things in the sonarqube server, login as admin.
Yes, the password is also `admin`.

![login as admin](images/sonarqube-login.png)

To activate the pylint rules inside sonarqube, create a new "quality profile" 

![create new quality profile](images/sonarqube-createqualityprofile.png) 

with a descriptive name (pylint), for python, and make it inherit from the profile 
called "Sonar way".

![new profile](sonarqube-newprofile)

Add more rules than the ones of "Sonar way" to the new quality profile.

![Activate more rules](images/sonarqube-activatemore.png)

Then activate the pylint "repository" 

![activate the pylint repo](images/sonarqube-selectpylintrepo.png)

and "bulk add" those rules to your new profile

![bulk add](images/sonarqube-bulkchange.png)


After that, make your newly created quality profile the default for your 
python projects.

![default pyling qp](images/sonarqube-pylintdefaultqp.png)


From the server side, this is it, you are ready. The next step is to add a
configuration file in your code for the `sonar-scanner`. But before doing this,
we must calculate the code metrics, and only after that we will upload them
using `sonar-scanner` to the `sonar-qube` server.

## Local metrics

We will consider creating the metrics for:

+ *security* using [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
+ *code coverage* using pytest 
+ *code smells and errors* using pylint

### Bandit

install bandit with the regular `conda` /  `pip` install.

run bandit with:

```bash
bandit --format json --output bandit-report.json --recursive my_library
```
### Code coverage

You already have your `tests` directory and have already installed pytest.
Then, run:

```bash
pytest --cov=my_library --cov-report xml:coverage-reports/coverage-my_library.xml tests
```
to create a coverage report parseable by `sonar-scanner`.

### code smells

You already have pylint installed, then run:
```bash
pylint my_library -r n --msg-template="{path}:{line}: [{msg_id}({symbol}), {obj}] {msg}" > pylint-report.txt
```


## Executing sonar-scanner

Create a file called `sonar-project.properties` at the top of the project.
You can safely start with the following contents:

```
sonar.projectKey = my_library 
sonar.sources = my_library
sonar.language =  py
sonar.python.xunit.reportPath = pytest-report.xml
sonar.python.bandit.reportPaths = bandit-report.json

sonar.python.pylint.reportPath = pylint-report.txt

```
Now that the metrics have been calculated, you can run `sonar-scanner` in your
project directory, and if all goes well, you will see open your project in `sonarqube`
and see the results of the analysis.
